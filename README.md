# Honyaku
Translate Anki decks to learn a target language from any other language!

If you enjoy learning languages, you most likely use a spaced repetiton system like Anki to learn vocab. Honyaku is a program that allows users to to input an Anki deck made for one language and have it come out in another. For example, if I have already learned Japanese, it will be much easier to learn a language like Korean in the context of Japanese due to how similar they are in grammar and vocab. However, there are not many decks out there with Korean vocab on the front and Japanese meaning on the back. This is where Honyaku comes in. Honyaku allows the user to input a deck in almost any language and choose the new language that will be on the back of the card. Going back to our example of Japanese and Korean, lets use this Korean to English deck: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917. 

Exporting the deck from Anki gives us a .tsv file that looks like this: ![image](https://github.com/nicksanchez42/Honyaku/assets/87837588/278bb14d-749e-4059-93c3-c9bea6d34152)

After running the file through Honyaku, we see that the field containing the English meaning is fully replaced and formatted to contain the meaning in Japanese:

When we go back into Anki we see that:

Has now become:

Thus giving us a deck that we can use to start learning Korean in Japanese!
